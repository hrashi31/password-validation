            <p class="card-text">Mutton curry (also referred to as kosha mangsho,[1] lamb curry,[2] or goat curry[3][4]) is a dish that is prepared from goat meat (or sometimes lamb meat) and vegetables.[5] The dish is found in different variations across all states, countries and regions of the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean.

                Mutton curry was originally prepared putting all the ingredients together in a earthen pot and slow cooking the whole curry by wood fire on a clay oven.[6] Today it is cooked using pressure cookers and slow cookers after briefly sautéing all the ingredients and spices in a big wok.[6] The steadily cooked mutton becomes more tender than normally cooked mutton. Mutton curry is generally served with rice or with Indian breads, such as naan or parotta.[7] The dish can also be served with ragi, a cereal.[8]</p>

            <p class="card-text">Biryani (/bɜːrˈjɑːni/) is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, goat, pork, lamb,prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables or paneer for the meat.[1] Sometimes eggs and/or potatoes are also added.[2]

                Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population in particular.[3] Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.[4] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.</p>
